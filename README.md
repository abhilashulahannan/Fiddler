## Description

Basically i want to add new feature to my samsung s24 ultra, which the stock OS lacks. These feature are available to playstore through apps but riddled with the ads, hidden behind paywall (Mostly subscription). And they are not to my needs. Hence The fiddler app will sole purpose is to better use my devices and customize it specifically for my needs. Currently the features I am planning-

- Internet-
    - Internet traffic monitor for status bar- It just adds the the monitor to the status bar to indicate network activity.
- Audio-
    - Auto Ringtone switcher- It will replace the system selected audio ringtone file with a song from a dedicated folder and switch them automatically.
- SecureMode-
    - Ideally i want my phone to become embarassment free when i hand out my device to other people.
    - In this i will have modes- Friends, family, Me. Which would be switchable from the quick setting tile. I want to some confidential items visible to certain modes.
- Fidland- Dynamic island-suited to my needs.
    - Effectively creating something like the dynamic island. it will have differnet island pages which will expand from the status bar.
        - 1 page for music apps like spotify, youtube, it will have horizontal swipe function to switch between apps
        - 2md page for next 5 songs on the playlist for active music app
        - 3rd page for 6-8 apps. Maybe add horizontal swipe here to add more apps.
        - Quick settings- Flashlight

Note: maybe integrate Other activities in the Dynamic Island - Fidland

# Fidland- fragment in fiddler

## Start point:

Basically just a black circle around the camera notch.

the theme is black throughout, the idea is to hide camera hole, using amoled display.

## Status bar expansion (These happen dynamically no physicall actions affect it)

### **1. Network Traffic Module (The circle expands to the left to form a pill shape)**

- Display real-time **upload/download speeds** (already implemented partly by you)
- It is just a visual thing, do not need to open any network thing with this

### **2. Equalizer / Media Info (Right Expansion)**

This part is dynamic if one of the following element is active then that is shown, if mutliple items active then they switch at 5 second interval. Some items will not switch if active like recording, timer, stopwatch etc.

- No click function in this part too.
- Animated **equalizer bars** that react to currently playing audio. basically 5-8 vertical lines type equaliser. Switchable
- Notification - Switchable
    - Stacks important notification visually by using app icons and adding badges for count/grouping.
    - Note the app icons are stacked on top of each other, showing each icon for 2 seconds then swtitching to next icon
- When charging ‚Üí show battery status ring around the camera hole
- When receiving a call ‚Üí pill expands with caller info
- When using voice recorder ‚Üí glowing red dot animation
- When hotspot or tethering ‚Üí add hotspot tethering icon

## Swipe expansion (Swiping down action on anywhere on the pill overlay willl trigger expansion)

This is your centerpiece. A **rounded rectangular overlay** with smooth fade/scale animations.
